The AirBnB clone project is a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/m8g02HcD2ovrl_K-zulYBw) that will be deployed on a server.

It implements only some of the features that cover fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

## Components

This project will be built step by step not all at once. It has different components.

### The console
-  creating a data model
-  manage (create, update, destroy, read) objects via a console / command interpreter
-  store and persists objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. The storage engine gives an abstraction between the objects and how they are stored an persisted. It will allow easy change in storage without need to update the entire codebase.
